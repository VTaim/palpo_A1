# A sample semantic model about Calvin and Hobbes 
#
# This document (unofficially) describes some of the characters etc. inspired
# by the popular comic strip "Calvin and Hobbes" by Bill Watterson.
#   The sole purpose of this document is to provide sample RDF (and later OWL) 
# model(s) for studying and playing around with semantic modeling. 
#   Ideas for simple "competency questions" (i.e. what can the model answer):
# - What are Calvin's family relationships like?
# - Who are the (main) characters?
# - Who are Calvin's friends?
# Having a simple domain like this helps understanding the modeling elements.
#   Reasoning requires a subset of OWL DL but should be rather intuitive.
#   Reading the comics does not help too much in learning semantic modeling
# but may certainly give you (other) pretty sophisticated ideas and is 
# of course great fun. :-)

# First a simple taxonomy (of the main concepts):

:Girl rdfs:subClassOf :Woman .
:Boy rdfs:subClassOf :Man .
:Woman rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person .
:Man rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person .
:AnthropomorphicToy rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person .
 
# Then explanation of the property :closeFriendOf; it is symmetric, i.e.
# cFO(x,y) <==> cFO(y,x) . So when the other side is asserted, the other 
# can be inferred --- but this requires using reasoner software.

:closeFriendOf a owl:SymmetricProperty . 
 
# Let's assert yet another axiom, saying that fam:childOf is
# inverse of fam:parentOf, i.e. cO(x,y) <==> pO(y,x). 
 
fam:childOf owl:inverseOf fam:parentOf . 

# A simple description of some of the comic's characters:
